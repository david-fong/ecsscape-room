## Ideas

- HTML global attributes

  - media query on `script-enable`, `width`, `height`, and `print`.

### Causes

- selector based on validity, placeholder-shown

### Effects

- grid area / position / z-index
- user-select / pointer-events
- width / height

- A mouse following puzzle:
  - An element that can only complete an animation while being hovered.
