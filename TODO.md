# Things To Do

Add cssnano to the build process when I'm ready to do a test release.

## Ideas

- HTML global attributes
  - title
  - tabindex
  - draggable
  - dir
  - contenteditable
  - accesskey

- CSS
  - media query on `script-enable`, `width`, `height`, and `print`.

### Causes

- selector based on validity, placeholder-shown

### Effects

- grid area / position / z-index
- user-select / pointer-events
- width / height

- A mouse following puzzle:
  - An element that can only complete an animation while being hovered.
  - The path must be cleared of other overlapping elements.

### Interesting Cause-Effect Combinations
