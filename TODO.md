## Ideas

  - title
  - tabindex
  - draggable
  - dir
  - contenteditable
  - accesskey

### Causes

- selector based on validity, placeholder-shown

### Effects

- grid area / position / z-index

- A mouse following puzzle:
  - An element that can only complete an animation while being hovered.
  - The path must be cleared of other overlapping elements.
